Part 1 - DHCP Server setup:

Begin by logging into your SonicWall firewall.
I'd recommend exporting your configuration before making any changes > "Manage" > "Firmware & Backup", select "Import/Export Configuration", select"Export Configuration".
When you've saved that, go to "Manage" > "Network" > "DHCP Server".
Under "DHCPv4 Server Lease Scopes", Press "ADD DYNAMIC".
Create a "Range Start", "Range End", and "Subnet Mask". Make sure the scope is not within the LAN. (Feel free to change the "Lease Time", although the default sufficient).
Go to the "DNS/WINS" tab.
If you have local DNS servers I'd suggest writing them here, as well as adding a public DNS if all local DNS servers are offline.
Take a look at the "Advanced" tab, none of it is required so we'll skip it.
Press "Save".


Part 2 - Creating Users & Groups (Skip this part if you already have users created).

Go to "Manage" > "Users" > "Local Users & Groups".
Press "Add". Minimum requirements are a "Name" and "Password". Feel free to add more like an email address etc.
Go to the "Groups" tab. Assign the user to the VPN group, by default this is "Trusted Users", if you have a special group for VPN make sure you assign it here.
Go to "VPN Access" tab. Assign access to the LAN interface, this is usually "X0 Subnet". Check your own setup, and make sure it's your LAN interface Subnet.


Part 3 - Creating the VPN Profile.

Go to "Manage" > "VPN" > "Base Settings".
Click the edit icon next to "WAN GroupVPN".
In the "General" tab, select the "Authentication Method", (I'd suggest using "IKE using Preshared Secret", unless you have the infrastructure in place already).
Under "Shared Secret" either use the auto-generated, or create your own.
Go to "Proposals", I'd suggest changing the default settings to improve security. I'll leave some recommendations below.
Go to "Advanced" tab, under "Client Authentication" Check the box "Require Authentication of VPN Clients by XAUTH". Then select the "User group for XAUTH users". 
Go to "Client" tab. First decide if you should allow Username and Password Caching.
Under "Client Connections" > "Virtual Adapter Settings" select "DHCP Lease"
Save and Exit.


Part 4 - DHCP over VPN.

Start by clicking "Configure" next to the drop down menu.
Check the box "Use Internal DHCP Server" and "For Global VPN Client".
Under "Relay IP Address" enter a reserved IP address from the same subnet as the DHCP Pool we created earlier. For example: Octet1.Octet2.Octet3.1
Save and Exit.


Part 5 - Client setup and test.

Download the Global VPN Client from https://mysonicwall.com
Install the program.
We'll need the public IP or a FQDN to connect. Use https://whatsmyip.com/ to find your public IP, or set up a subdomain for the VPN: vpn.example.com
We'll also need the Preshared Secret we created in Part 3.
In GVC, go to File > New...
Enter the IP address or FQDN from before, and give it a recognizable name. Then save and exit the window.
Highlight the connection we created, then press enable.
You'll be prompted for the preshared key, copy and paste it here. Press OK.
Enter your username and password. Press OK.
Now you should be connected, and be able to reach internal resources.
